Here are the most interesting options, roughly ranked:

  plan_path — Claude chooses start + end coordinates (using get_entities to find unit positions or waypoints) and tells the client to run the
  existing A* terrain pathfinder. The result is a terrain-hugging LIME route on the map. This is the most compelling because Claude's
  reasoning drives a computationally heavy operation that already exists. Prompt: "Route 1 Plt to waypoint B3, avoid exposed terrain".

  draw_circle — Claude places a circle entity on the map: threat zones, LZ coverage, exclusion areas, observation post radii. Pure Cesium
  primitive, no server side, very easy. Prompt: "Mark a 500m threat zone around the enemy position I'm looking at".

  add_waypoints — Claude places a sequence of pins on the map forming a route. Less interesting than plan_path because it's just coordinates,
  not terrain-aware movement.

  set_level — Claude switches between squad/platoon/company/battalion display. Trivial (one function call), only useful as part of a compound
  action.

  move_unit — Claude repositions a military unit. Most complex: requires mutating the JSON tree on disk and reloading client entities.
